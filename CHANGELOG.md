## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial LakeHouse-LLP public open-source template scaffold (CI, OpenSSF Scorecard, CodeQL, DCO, gitleaks, README autogen, tier and runner guards).
- `.lakehouse/org.json` identity (orgName / brand / packageScope / domain) and `.lakehouse/pins.json` action + reusable-workflow catalog.
- Org-slug lint (`check:org-slug`), action-pin check (`check:pins`), and CITATION.cff generation from org.json.
- `docs/org.md` pointing at the organization `.github` runbook.

### Fixed

- Remote URL parsing avoids host substring checks (CodeQL).
- Lychee config uses `include_mail = false` (CLI no longer accepts `--exclude-mail`).
- Dependency-review Action deferred until the owner enables Dependency graph (agents do not change settings).
- Guards, README AUTO badges, and citations no longer hardcode the GitHub org slug (brand + custom domain instead).
- `org.json` domain is `REPLACE_WITH_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` (no assumed hostname); brand set to `LakeHouse`.
